# Object-Recognition-Using-CNNs

#### Project 1 in a series of small projects designed to practice practical Machine Learning. 

This project is an implementation of the 2015 ICLR paper, "Striving For Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net". <br>
The link for the paper is : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6806.pdf <br/>

The dataset used can be found on the following link : <a> https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html </a> 

> Alternately, the dataset used can be found in the following link: <a>https://github.com/ThaWeatherman/scrapers/tree/master/boardgamegeek</a>, titled 'games.csv'

### Cloning the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AnindKiran/Board-Game-Prediction
cd Board-Game-Prediction
```

### Prerequisites libraries

It is presumed that you have at least Python 3.7. 
The prerequisites include: sklearn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. Although using conda would be preferable, the following commands use pip to install libraries considering most people have the 'pip' utility. Use the following commands to install them: 
```sh
pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
```

### Using the notebook
Open Jupyter Notebook using the following command on the cmd / terminal (depending on your platform): 
```
jupyter notebook
```

The notebook will be visible for you to use.
